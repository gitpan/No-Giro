=head1 NAME

No::Giro - Perl Module for generating Norwegian bank slips

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use No::Giro;
  use PostScript::Simple;
  my $p = new PostScript::Simple(papersize => "A4",
				 colour => 0,
				 eps => 0,
				 units => "mm");
  $p->newpage;
  my $giro = new No::Giro;
  $giro->kid(242345);
  $giro->belop(4534);
  $giro->tilkonto(12345678901);
  $giro->bettil(["Payme", 'Somewhere', '4932 Place']);
  my $e = $giro->eps;
  $p->importeps($e, 0,0);
  $p->output("giro.ps");


=head1 DESCRIPTION

It provides some methods to enter data into a standard F60-1 GIRO
slip. This is an A4 sheet with a standard layout and where data are
entered at the bottom and there is some space to enter any information
at the top. It returns an Encapsulated Postscript object that can be
used in a Postscript document, which again is suitable to be printed. 


=head2 Data Methods

These are the accessor methods, they serve only the purpose of setting and retrieving the values of the data fields of the object. 

These methods have Norwegian-looking names, except for that they are abbreviations and has not Norwegian characters, so I suppose you need to be Norwegian to understand them, or grab someone who is... 

=over

=item C<belop()>

The amount of money to be paid. 

=item C<frist()>

Date payment is due. Currently, it should be a simple string. 

=item C<betav()>

Name and address of the person or institution making the payment. It is an array where each element represents a line. It takes 3-4 lines and does not attempt to check that it is within bounds. 

=item C<bettil()>

Name and address of the person or institution getting the payment. Like above, it is an array where each element representing a line. 

=item C<betinf()>

Payment information. This field can contain comments without any particular semantics. It is an array of strings, where each element represents an array. Each element should not exceed 40 characters, but only a warning is issued if it does.



=item C<kid()>

The customer identification number, or KID. You need agreements with the banking system to actually use this meaningfully. There are constraints on length of numbers and how they are to be computed. Contact your bank for details if you plan to use this. 

=item C<tilkonto()>

The account number to be credited. 



=item C<betkonto()>

The account number of the payer.


=item C<belkonto()>

Does nothing. 

=item C<kvittering()>

Does nothing.

=head2 Other Methods

=over

=item C<new()>

The constructor of this class.

=cut

 
# Snip verbatim from perltoot by Tom Christiansen.
sub new {
    my $that  = shift;
    my $class = ref($that) || $that;
    my $self  = {
	_permitted => \%fields,
	%fields,
    };
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}



# Uhm, because of my autoload method, I don't know what to do with the destructor, so I just do this....:
sub DESTROY { # Do nothing 
}


sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $self = shift;
    my $type = ref($self)
	or croak "$self is not an object";
    my $name = $AUTOLOAD;
    $name =~ s/.*://;   # strip fully-qualified portion
    unless (exists $self->{_permitted}->{$name} ) {
	croak "Can't access `$name' field in class $type";
    }
    if (@_) {
      my $entry = shift;
      if ($name eq 'betinf') {
	my $i=1;
	foreach my $line (@{$entry}) {
	  if (length($line) > 40) {
	    carp("Length of line $i in betinf() is longer than 40 characters. This is discouraged");
	    $i++;
	  }
	}
      }
      return $self->{$name} = $entry;
    } else {
      return $self->{$name};
    }
  }

=item C<eps>

This method uses whatever data that has been previously set by the data methods, and puts them in appropriate positions, and returns a L<PostScript::Simple::EPS> object. You may then use this object to import in a L<PostScript::Simple> document, save it to a file or whatever. Just remember that it has to be imported at the very bottom of the an A4 page.

sub eps {
    my $self = shift;

				     xsize => 206,
				     ysize => 123,
				     eps => 1,
				     units => "pt");

    my $kroner = int($self->{belop}); 
    my $ore = int(($self->{belop} - $kroner) * 100);

    $eps->setfont("Courier-iso", 4);
    
    $eps->text(1.8,    21.5, 'H');
    $eps->text(20,     21.5, $self->{kid});
    $eps->text(86,     21.5, $kroner);
    if ($ore > 0) {
      $eps->text(108,  21.5, $ore);
    }
    $eps->text(132,    21.5, $self->{tilkonto});
    $eps->text(86,     106,  $self->{belop});
    $eps->text(132,    106,  $self->{betkonto});

    if($self->{betinf}) {
	my $feed = 93; 
	foreach my $line (@{$self->{betinf}}) {
	    $eps->text(15, $feed, $line);
	    $feed-=4;
	}
    }

    if($self->{bettil}) {

=head1 BUGS/TODO

This is an early release, mostly thrown together to meet the needs of
the author. As is seen from the method documentation, it has methods
to set all sensible fields, but not all of them are implemented to
print anything. The fields that are unimplemented in this release are
both something that very few issuers of these slips would ever need to
do, and this module addresses their concerns mainly.

The standard strongly recommends the use of the ISO OCR B font for the
fields that are to be OCRed, allthough Courier is also supported. 
I haven't got OCRB to work, even on a machine that has it, so for now, Courier-iso has been hardcoded as the font to use.

Internally, I have noted some problems with the measuring units, but
right now it "works for me" and I have little time to grok the
problem.

The module could also do some checking that KID and account numbers
are valid, that's also a TODO.

I should probably have read the fine specifications for this stuff,
but it is not quite clear to me what applies... Pointers are
appreciated.

For other issues, please use the CPAN Request Tracker to report bugs.
